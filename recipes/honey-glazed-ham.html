    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This honey glazed ham tastes very much like the famous honey baked ham but costs much less, and there's no need
        to fight the crowds at holiday time. You can even buy the ham presliced to make it easier and more like the
        original. It is very good. I make this while preparing the rest of the meal in the kitchen so that I don't
        forget to baste!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ham:</strong> This recipe calls for one 5-pound ready-to-eat ham. If your ham is larger or smaller,
            you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloves:</strong> Aromatic whole cloves ¼ of a cup add warm and spicy-sweet flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Honey: </strong> Of course, you'll need honey 2 cups. Pro-tip: Spray your measuring cup with cooking spray
            so the honey slides out easily.</li>
        <li><strong>Corn Syrup:</strong> Dark corn syrup ¼ of a cup, adds more flavor and contributes to caramelization. Some
            reviewers suggest substituting brown sugar or using a combination of corn syrup and brown sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Butter ⅔ of a cup adds and helps retain moisture, resulting in a juicy honey-baked ham that's
            impossible to resist.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Score ham, and stud with whole cloves. Place ham in foil-lined pan. </li>
        <li> Heat corn syrup, honey, and butter in the top half of a double boiler; keep glaze warm while baking ham. </li>
        <li> Brush glaze over ham, and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven. </li>
        <li> Baste ham every 10 to 15 minutes with the honey glaze. During the last 4 to 5 minutes of baking, turn on broiler to caramelize the glaze. Remove from oven, and let sit a few minutes before serving. </li>
        <li> Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
