    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is my best chili recipe. After years of adjusting recipes that were either too spicy or too mild, everyone
        loves this. Even my fiancée who hates chili.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 pound ground beef </li>
        <li> 1 onion, chopped </li>
        <li> 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce </li>
        <li> 1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans </li>
        <li> 1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes </li>
        <li> 1 ½ cups water, or as needed (Optional) </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon chili powder, or more to taste</li>
        <li> 1 pinch garlic powder </li>
        <li> salt and pepper to taste </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>  Place ground beef and onion in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until meat is browned and onion is tender, about 5 to 7 minutes.  </li>
        <li> Stir in tomato sauce, kidney beans, and stewed tomatoes with juice. If you prefer a thinner consistency, you can add water. Season with chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer for 15 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
